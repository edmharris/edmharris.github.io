    <h2>England</h2>
    <p>After a few early years living in the county of Kent, I grew up in Peterborough in the county of Cambridgeshire, east of England and lived there until I attended Lancaster University in the north-west at the age of 17. 
	Following University, where I graduated with a degree in Philosophy and a Masters in Organizational Behaviour, I moved to London, the capital city of England, and lived there for 8 years before moving to Canada.</p>
    <p>London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>

    <h2>Sweden</h2>
    <p>The maternal side of the family is from the southern most county of Skåne where the 16 km Øresund bridge connects Denmark with Sweden - Europe’s longest road and rail bridge. 
	I lived in Gothenburg for the first six years of my life and have English / Swedish parentage.</p> 
    <p>Malmö is the capital city of Skåne county and the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg.</p>

    <h2>Canada</h2>
    <p>I moved to Canada in 2006 in my early 30s and established a family with my then Spouse in the town of Stratford and have two wonderful children. Following our separation, I met my current Spouse and 
	became based in a nearby Ontario town and enjoy all the wonderful aspects of blended family life.</p>
    <p>Canada is an incredible country and I can't wait to continue to explore all that it has to offer.</p>
